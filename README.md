## Noora Al Qasimi

I am a curious person who is passionate about learning new things. Before starting at Makers Academy (MA), I taught myself the basics of Xcode and developed a simple card game. That feeling of gratification I had when I completed building the game was what truly propelled me in the direction of coding. Check out my [blog](https://medium.com/@n.k.alqasimi) where I talk about my experience at MA.

Having come from an engineering background, I've always had a technical mind and I realised that I have a passion for problem-solving, no matter the kind of problem. That, combined with my interest in coding led me to seek out a chance to improve myself technically at Makers Academy. After completing this intensive course at MA, I will be looking for a junior developer role in an energetic and inspiring environment where I can offer my skills with all the best practices I've learned at MA and continue to learn and build upon my skills.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker

My degree in Chemical Engineering involved complex problems, where I learned how to break large problems into smaller ones. There, I established a solid approach to problem solving.
•	Third year project - designed a theoretical Biodiesel production plant
•	Investigated suitable raw materials
•	Performed in depth analysis of the plant and its components
•	Improved plant design and production yield based on the knowledge gained and the use of optimisation software

#### Team player

I'm confident in working on my own but I also greatly appreciate the value of working as part of a team. During my practice project week at MA, my group and I decided to build an arcade racing game in JavaScript.
•	Maintained a common headspace via regular stand-ups and retros
•	Split off into pairs when appropriate to maximise efficiency
•	Communicated my ideas effectively 
•	Worked well as a team because of giving/receiving constant feedback 
•	Completed the game on time along with extensive testing
•	Our coach was impressed by the end result and how we achieved a extensively tested functional super fun obstacle-dodging car racing game

#### Attention to detail

For my final project at MA, I took part in building an Alexa skill for the Amazon Echo. Being a completely new technology with a lack of extensive documentation, we faced some struggles along the way.
•	Faced a problem with Alexa’s tone and pronunciation of several phrases 
•	Had to manipulate speech output through the use of SSML
•	Saw the consequences of the smallest change
•	It was a success as Alexa ended up saying things the way we wanted

- Languages: Arabic (native), English (fluent), French (intermediate).
- Adobe Photoshop
