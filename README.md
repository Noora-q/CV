## Noora Al Qasimi

I am a curious person who is passionate about learning new things. Before starting at Makers Academy (MA), I taught myself the basics of Xcode and developed a simple card game. That feeling of gratification I had when I completed building the game was what truly propelled me in the direction of coding. Check out my [blog](https://medium.com/@n.k.alqasimi) where I talk about my experience at MA.

Having come from an engineering background, I've always had a technical mind and I realised that I have a passion for problem-solving, no matter the kind of problem. That, combined with my interest in coding led me to seek out a chance to improve myself technically at Makers Academy. After completing this intensive course at MA, I will be looking for a junior developer role in an energetic and inspiring environment where I can offer my skills with all the best practices I've learned at MA and continue to learn and build upon my skills.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker

My degree in Chemical Engineering involved complex problem-solving, and I learned how to break large problems into smaller bits, tackling each one at a time. As part of my third year project, I designed a theoretical Biodiesel production plant, which involved a variety of tasks. These included researching suitable raw materials, performing analysis of the plant and its components as well as using optimisation software.

#### Team player

I'm confident in working on my own but I also greatly appreciate the value of working as part of a team. During summer school at Imperial, I took on a group project in which we assumed the role of a marketing consultancy and were required to develop a more effective marketing strategy for the future growth of our chosen company in the healthcare industry. Our coaches were very impressed with our final recommendations, which were a result of our effective teamwork.

#### Attention to detail

Overall, my experience with coding has shown me the importance of attention to detail. It only takes a single character in order for your code to result in an error. It is a great advantage to have an observant eye and to be able to spot the effect of the smallest changes on the final result, as often the smallest mistakes can lead to the largest consequences.

- Languages: Arabic (native), English (fluent), French (intermediate).
- Adobe Photoshop
